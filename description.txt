########################################Prime Number#########################################

Hello everyone her i am providing the most efficient algo for finding prime numbers.
The way this program work it provide best case with complixcity of (3n/2).
Now on this program.
In the first line an list name as List contain all prime number which exist in between 0 to 9
which is 2,3,5 and 7. but the fact is why i will take that before is because all the integers are the combination of 0 to 9 so if any 
number which is devidable by all the prime number present in between 0 to 9 can devide any number than that number never be an prime
number else it will be a prime.
so if the condition is true than it will append those prime number in the same list.
Now here is another question is that why this loop has increment with 2 in place of 1, so here we know that there is 0 percent posssibility
that any even number is a prime number so we just need odd number to find out that it is prime or not.
It's all about this program.
